<h6>Interpretation:</h6>

<li>The headings of the Agreement are for convenience only and are not to be used for its interpretation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Opening of Account:</h6>
<ol>
<li>Subject to the terms of the Agreement the Client shall apply to get an account with the Company (the “Account”), where the available balance will be used to facilitate the Client’s activity in the digital assets and currency pairs available for trading (the “Trading Instruments”). The Client acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Account is a non-interest-bearing account, and the Client shall not be entitled to any interest on any balance presented in the Account, and (ii) except for Client’s right to execute transactions and withdraw the available balance from the Account, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement herein, the Client shall have no other interest in the Account, and (iii) the Client’s use of the Account and Client’s right to obtain the Services is subject to the Company’s consent, based, inter alia, on its know your client (also known as KYC) procedures (as further elaborated below).</li>
<li>The Client hereby instructs the Company to set up the Account in the Client’s name. The Client hereby irrevocably declares that s/he is acting for his own sole benefit and not for and/or on behalf of any other person or entity. Should the Client attempt to open more than one account under the Client’s own name or under any other name or should the Client attempt to use the Services by means of any other person’s account, the Company will be entitled to take protective measurements such as (but not limited to) immediately close all Client’s pending transactions and Accounts, retain all funds in the Accounts and exclude Client from future use of the Services.</li>
<li>The Client understands and accepts that upon its registration to the Website, and at any time thereafter, the Company will enforce conduct a due diligence process on him/her (the “KYC Process”) and anti-money laundering checks (“AML Checks”). The KYC Process and the AML Checks may require the Company to obtain certain documents from the Client which shall typically include an identity card, passport or driver’s license, proof of address such as a utility bill, and proof of payment method. If deemed necessary, the Company may request additional documents and/ or that any document copies are notarized, meaning that the documents are stamped and attested by a Notary Public. In the event that any requests for documents and information are not completed by the Client in timely manner or otherwise approved by the Company, the Company may &#8211; at its sole discretion &#8211; decline to open an Account, block an Account from trading or terminate this Agreement, and may withhold any balance that is<br />
present in the Account until such time as the Company is satisfied with the documents presented by the Client. Should the documents fail the Company’s internal compliance checks or applicable law the Company shall be under no obligation to accept such documents as valid, and under no obligation to provide feedback on the exact nature of its findings with regards to these documents.</li>
<li>Anti-Money Laundering and the prevention of Terrorist Financing: The Company will not tolerate any attempt to use the Services, or get the Company associated, with the illicit activities of money laundering of terrorist financing in any other way. The Company has therefore implemented policies in place to deter people from laundering money. These policies include (but not limited to): ensuring Clients have valid proof of identification; maintaining records of identification information; determining that Clients are not known or suspected terrorists by checking their names against watch lists; informing Clients that the information they provide may be used to verify their identity; closely following the Clients’ activity; and, not accepting cash, money orders, third party transactions, exchange houses transfers or Western Union (or similar) transfers. Money laundering occurs when funds from an illegal/criminal activity are moved through the financial system in such a way as to make<br />
it appear that the funds have come from legitimate sources. Money Laundering usually follows three stages: firstly, cash orcash equivalents are placed into the financial system; secondly, money is transferred or moved to other accounts (e.g. futures accounts) through a series of financial transactions designed to obscure the origin of the money (e.g. executing trades with little or no financial risk or transferring account balances to other accounts); and finally, the funds are re-introduced into the economy so that the funds appear to have come from legitimate sources (e.g. closing a futures account and transferring the funds to a bank account). The Company is concerned that the Accounts will be exploit as a vehicle to launder illicit funds or to hide the true owner of the funds. In particular, an Account may be used to facilitate financial activity that help obscure the origins of the Client’s funds. The Company directs funds withdrawals back to the original source of remittance, as a preventative measure. International Anti-Money Laundering requires institutions are to be notified of potential<br />
money laundering abuses that could occur in the Account and the Company implement a program to deter, detect and report potential suspicious activity. These guidelines have been implemented to protect the Company and the Clients. For questions/comments regarding these guidelines, please contact the Company representative as per the contact details available at the “contact us” section at the Website.</li>
